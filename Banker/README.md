# Banker's Algorithm Lab

## Introduction
The goal of this lab is to do resource allocation using both an optimistic resource manager and the bankerâ€™s algorithm of Dijkstra.

## Use Instructions
Compile the Tester java file with `javac Tester.java`
Run with `java Tester [inputname]`

## Output
Outputs the FIFO and Banker's Algorithm details:
The time taken, waiting time, and percentage of time spent of each task.
Total time for all tasks, total waiting time, and overall percentage of time spent waiting.
